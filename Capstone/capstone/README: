README:

This project was origeonally an attempt to interface with my Physics 2
capstone.

However, that didnt end up working out because I broke the arduino leonardo I purchased, probably because I plugged it into my surface pro.

Also, I had a very hard time getting a mouse position listener to behave correctly.

The project is now just the flappy andrew game, and it does make use of a lot of techniques from many units in the class, including a keyboard listener, graphics, colors, software design, and logic.

In order to run the code, run the main method on the veiwer class.

Press the up button on the keyboard to flap, the score is placed in the title of the project. If you loose, rerun the game to try again.
